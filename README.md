Public repository for the CloudGuides Web Applicaiton

## :grey_question:	About
CloudGluides is a web application for creating, and posting educational content related to cloud service providers (i.e. Azure, and Amazon Web Services).  
It includes a:
<ul>
    <li>Content management system for performing all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for each post</li>
    <li>Account management for creating new accounts, and controlling logins</li>
    <li>Built in SMTP email service for sending messages to an approved domain, from the “Contact us” section</li>
</ul>
It’s currently configured to use MySQL server as the primary persistent storage method, which is hosted on AWS Relational Database Service (RDS). 


## :exclamation:    Note
Please note that, due to licensing restrictions, none of the front-end web pages/views have been included in the repository. All backend files have been included and are functional. 
Also, due to security reasons, the SMTP email settings, and database connection details have been removed from the corresponding config files.
